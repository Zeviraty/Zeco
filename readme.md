# Zeco (zev ecosystem)

Zeco is a personal project where I build tools / apps using only Python's built-in libraries and my own code. The idea is to better understand how things work under the hood by creating a tiny ecosystem of tools / apps that can work together — no external dependencies, just the standard library.

This isn't meant to be production-grade or highly optimized — it's mostly for exploration, experimentation, and fun.

## Applications
 - [Web server](https://www.github.com/Zeviraty/zws) A simple, lightweight HTTP server built with sockets. It's not secure or feature-rich, but it works well for basic testing.
